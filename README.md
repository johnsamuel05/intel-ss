PROBLEM STATEMENT:
To develop a real-time sign language translation system that accurately translates Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures into spoken language or text, using Intel oneAPI OpenVINO to ensure efficient and performant execution.

SOLUTION:
• Acquisition of diverse INDIAN SIGN LANGUAGE(ISL) image data and extract relevant features like hand location,orientation, fingers.
• Training a deep learning model for ISL recognition.
• Converting the model to an optimized format (IR) using OpenVINO for efficient execution on Intel hardware.
• Developing an application using OpenVINO to capture video, process features, and translate signs to text or speech.
• And, continuously evaluating and refining the system to improve accuracy and real-time performance.

METHODOLOGY:
Collect diverse ISL image data---> Extract key features---> Developing ISL models---> Convert model to IR using OpenVINO---> Develop an application using OpenVINO's inference engine---> Evaluate and refine system
